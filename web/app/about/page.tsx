            <h2>What does Pocket do?</h2>
            <p>Pocket answers one question: how much money do you have left? You enter the amount you have today. After that, every purchase and payment you record changes the number in the menu bar.</p>
            <p>Bills, subscriptions and paychecks can repeat on their own. Income you're still waiting for stays out of the balance until you confirm what arrived. Plan shows your balance for the next 1, 3, 6 or 12 months, and the date it would run out. Insights shows where each month's money went.</p>

          <section id="who-its-for">
            <h2>Who is Pocket for?</h2>
            <p>People with a Mac who want to always know how much money they have left, without linking a bank account. Because every entry is typed, Pocket works the same with any bank, in any country and in any currency.</p>
            <p><Text>{"It helps most when income doesn't arrive on a fixed schedule, for example [freelance pay](/guides/freelance-income/). If you'd rather have transactions imported automatically, a bank-sync app will suit you better. Read [manual tracking vs bank sync](/guides/manual-vs-bank-sync/) to decide."}</Text></p>
