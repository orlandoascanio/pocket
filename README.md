# Pocket

How much money is left, everywhere.

## Pocket for Mac

`mac/` is the Mac app. By default your money stays on your Mac in one JSON file
(`~/Library/Application Support/Pocket/ledger.json`, with 7 daily backups), with no account and no server.

To use Pocket on a phone or another computer too, connect it to a server (Settings → Sync). Anyone can run
their own: a free Supabase project with this repo's SQL. See **[SELF-HOSTING.md](SELF-HOSTING.md)**.
While connected, the server is the main copy. The Mac keeps a full copy (`account-ledger.json`), works offline,
and sends changes in order once it's back online (`account-sync.json` holds the outbox). Requests that time out
wait for review instead of being sent again, so nothing posts twice. The access key lives in the Keychain.

- Menubar balance, plus a window with Overview, Plan (forecast chart), Insights and Settings.
- Repeating money that can wait for confirmation, quick-add buttons (⌘1–⌘9), categories, reminders when money is due.
- `swift test` (in `mac/`) runs the money-logic tests and the app tests, including sync against a mock server
  (`Tests/PocketAppTests/AccountSyncTests.swift`). Set `POCKET_SNAPSHOT_DIR` to also render screen previews.
- `./mac/build.sh` builds a universal app signed with Developer ID; `NOTARY_PROFILE=<name> ./mac/build.sh --release`
  also notarizes, staples and makes `dist/Pocket-<version>.dmg`.
- Development only: `open mac/dist/Pocket.app --env POCKET_DATA_DIR=/tmp/demo --env POCKET_OPEN=main --env POCKET_SECTION=Plan`
  runs against a separate data folder (and an in-memory key) and opens a window at launch.

### Releasing a new version

One-time setup: save your notarization login in the keychain (needs an app-specific password from account.apple.com):

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "pocket-notary" --apple-id YOUR_APPLE_ID_EMAIL --team-id VW98Z8698B
```

Then, for each release:

1. Bump the version and build. This builds, signs, notarizes and staples the app and the DMG, then checks both with Gatekeeper:

   ```bash
   NOTARY_PROFILE=pocket-notary VERSION=1.0.1 ./mac/build.sh --release
   ```

2. Publish it. The asset must be named `Pocket.dmg` so the download page's "latest" link keeps working:

   ```bash
   cp mac/dist/Pocket-1.0.1.dmg /tmp/Pocket.dmg
   gh release create v1.0.1 /tmp/Pocket.dmg --repo orlandoascanio/pocket --title "Pocket for Mac 1.0.1" --notes "What changed…" --latest
   ```

3. Check it: `https://github.com/orlandoascanio/pocket/releases/latest/download/Pocket.dmg` should download the new version.

## Web app and server

- `web/`: the website at [pocketleft.app](https://pocketleft.app), a Next.js site hosted on Vercel (project Root Directory: `web`).
  `/` is the Pocket for Mac download page. `npm run dev` in `web/` runs it locally.
  See [web/SEO-SETUP.md](web/SEO-SETUP.md) for the SEO audit and Google Search Console, GA4, and Sentry setup.
- `web/public/app/`: the web app, served as-is at [pocketleft.app/app](https://pocketleft.app/app/). Works on a phone and any
  computer; add it to your home screen. It talks to the original Pocket server unless you choose **Use your own server**
  (or open a pairing link from the Mac, which fills in the server and code).
- `docs/`: redirects only. GitHub Pages still serves `orlandoascanio.github.io/pocket`, which Pocket for Mac 1.1.0 opens
  for pairing; it forwards to pocketleft.app and keeps the pairing code.
- `supabase/migrations/`: the database. Tables are locked; everything goes through key-gated `pocket_*` functions.
  `pocket_setup` claims an empty database once, for self-hosting.
- `supabase/tests/`: database tests. Run `./supabase/tests/run.sh` (everything is rolled back).
- `design/`: the icon source. `swift design/make-icons.swift` regenerates every icon.

What it does:
- One-time spending and income on any date; future dates count when the day arrives.
- Repeating bills, subscriptions and income (weekly, every 2 weeks, monthly, yearly), with or without an end.
  Income can wait for you to confirm it arrived, then "Got it" logs the real amount and date. Pause, skip, or stop any of them.
- Categories, a monthly breakdown, and a forecast (1, 3, 6 or 12 months) of when the money runs out.
- Quick-add buttons (keys 1–9 on the web, ⌘1–⌘9 on the Mac) and keyboard shortcuts (press ? on the web).
- New entries made offline wait on the device and sync when it's back online.
- Devices pair with a 6-digit code from one that's already set up, and can be removed from Settings.
- A daily GitHub Action pings the database so the free Supabase project never pauses (see SELF-HOSTING.md to do the same).

The secret key is never stored in this repo.
